    "motivations": "I want to be a DRep because I believe the Cardano ecosystem is the only truly decentralized blockchain that gives everybody a voice. I very much want to move my business and professional portfolio to the Cardano ecosystem, away from the legacy framework. Professional experiences I can contribute are 11 years of academia, as well as 15 years of business ownership. On a personal level, I am very much interested in becoming DRep due to my love of anything to do with computers. Cardano offers this, where I can base my personal and professional experiences on my business, as well as computers.",
    "objectives": "What I believe and what I want to achieve as a DRep is to carry on with my objective, which is to allow people to open their documents which are stored long-term. My innovative product will allow businesses and individuals to utilize this service, connecting through B2B and B2C. By delegating to my wallet for my business to become a DRep, it will allow a very interesting and productive experience used by those in Cardano. I believe being a DRep would allow others to see my business useful, which includes the services it offers.",

    "qualifications": "Qualifications I believe are relevant to my role as a DRep are the amount of time I have put into the space since 2021. As a stock trader, I moved to blockchain due to finding NFTs. I then moved to Solidity programming but found Cardano based on a love for peer-reviewed research. This, combined with an easy developer experience and beautiful community has led me to focusing on Cardano all around. I also posses qualifications in project management and a scientific discovery, which I presented at colloquia throughout the United States. I am still continuing on with my discovery, but want to implement my findings into the Cardano Ecosystem. After my discovery, I proved my theorems at peer-reviewed conferences. I can now continue my findings, hopefully adding value as a DRep for those to learn from my findings. My main goal to contribute to the Ecosystem is the writing of papers, which the community can adopt as their own.",
